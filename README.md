PAVEL
=====

Pavel (Paretoset Analysis, Visualization and Evaluation) is a tool for
interactively displaying and evaluating large sets of highdimensional data.
Its main intended use is the analysis of result sets from multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

Pavel requires
  - Windows 2000/XP/Vista (Vista needs elevated privileges during installation)
  - An OpenGL capable graphics driver
  - Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0

INSTALLATION & CONFIGURATION FILES
----------------------------------

The Pavel Installer copies Pavel to the designated location, registers the
file extension ".pav" and places a shortcut on the desktop and in the start
menu. No other actions are performed during the installation.

When run, Pavel creates a file under %APPDATA%\PG500\Pavel that stores recently
opened Projects.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

Unfortunately, there is no english-language user documentation available.
The API-description is stored as doc-comments in the sourcecode.
The final report for the Pavel project run at ISF Uni Dortmund contains a
german-language user manual.
It can be found at http://pavel.googlecode.com/files/pavel_endbericht.pdf
