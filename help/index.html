            <h1>Pavel</h1>

            <p>Pavel (Paretoset Analysis Visualization and Evaluation) is a tool for interactively displaying and evaluating large sets of highdimensional data. Its main intended use is the analysis of result sets from multi-objective evolutionary algorithms applied to machining problems but it can basically work with any kind of multidimensional data.</p> 
            <p>While there exist solutions that fulfill some of the listed purposes, none of them is combining them in a way that is useful for the evaluation of MOEA result sets. A unique feature of Pavel is further the ability to handle extremely large data sets well enough to enable interactive evaluation (At least up to 100.000 points in 40 dimensions). Pavel is easily extendable through plugin interfaces and can be applied to many different use cases.</p> 
            <p>The project was developed as a student research project at Dortmund University and started almost a year ago. This project is nearing its end, the software is usable but still leaves room for improvement. To make the effort spent worthwhile, it was decided to release the software as opensource in the hope that others may find it useful and to enable development to continue.</p>
            
            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Visualize</strong> large data sets in several ways (Scatterplots, Parallelplots, Scatter Matrices, Tables)</li>
                <li><strong>Cluster</strong> data using different clustering algorithms (K-Means, HACM)</li>
                <li><strong>Compare</strong> individual points in the data set</li>
                <li><strong>Analyze</strong> data with algorithms related to the actual use case</li>
                <li><strong>Extendable</strong> through plugin interfaces (applied to many different use cases)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Report</h2>
            <p>
                The final report written for the student research project at ISF is available <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/pavel/pavel_endbericht.pdf">here</a>.
                It contains a german-language user manual, a brief developer manual, and technical information on the problems that motivated the development of Pavel.
