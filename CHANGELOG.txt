Changes since last release
* Removed parametrized constructor from the CSV parser.
* CSV-Parser now allows to define Spaces in the Column Heads.
  Just seperate the space and the column Name by a ":". A column named "Decision Space: Parameter X" will be
  named "Parameter X" in Pavel and added to a space called "Decision Space". See the unit test for an example.
* MLA Clustering implemented
* Replaced "Copy selected points into new PointSet" and "Copy not selected points into new PointSet" with a simply copy function in the PointSetManager.
  The same functions can easily and more intuitivly achieved by the deleting- and inverting functions in the visualizations.
* Added possibity to invert the current selection in every visualization for the visible pointset

1.0.1beta:

* Corrected some descriptions of the properties of the Scatterplot (Default value for point size is 8, but was said to be 3, Default for Alpha-value is 80%, but the description said 50%).
* Opening a Scatterplot from the Scattermatrix now results in a 2D Scatterplot instead of a 3D Scatterplot.
