Changes since last release
--------------------------
* Enhanced 3D-Paretofinder, decreased runtime drastically, tieded up the code and replaced the ParetoFinder-ProgressBar with the ProgressBar in the MainWindow
* Bugfix: Scales in Scatterplot are rendered correctly now
* Lines for Points in the CurrentSelection are now drawn correctly in front of all the other lines
* Changed method for showing and hiding VisualizationToolstrips from the Merge/RevertMerge crap to just
  adding/removing them frmo the topToolStripPanel.
* Progressbar added to the ParetoFinder
* Got rid of the FreeToolStrip
* Moved Reset/Save/SaveAs functions for spaces from the individual VisToolStrips to the common Baseclass.
  Now it's possible to save/reset the space from the scatterplot too + no more duplicate code.
* Picking in Scatterplot is faster now due to using glLoadName instead of glPushName/glPopName
* Buxfix of Clustering with Smart-Repair
* Fixed Problem with empty clusters in k-means. SmartRepair option added for k-means and MLA
* Added possibility to select different decimal-seperator characters for the csv-parser.
  Supports "," and "." as seperators.
* Listing BugFix (Crash on NaN-Values)
* Removed parametrized constructor from the CSV parser.
* CSV-Parser now allows to define Spaces in the Column Heads.
  Just seperate the space and the column Name by a ":". A column named "Decision Space: Parameter X" will be
  named "Parameter X" in Pavel and added to a space called "Decision Space". See the unit test for an example.
* MLA Clustering implemented
* Replaced "Copy selected points into new PointSet" and "Copy not selected points into new PointSet" with a simply copy function in the PointSetManager.
  The same functions can easily and more intuitivly achieved by the deleting- and inverting functions in the visualizations.
* Added possibity to invert the current selection in every visualization for the visible pointset

1.0.1beta:
----------
* CSVParser.Parse(StreamReader) instead of CSVParser.Parse(StreamReader)
* IParser Interface removed
  Class Diagram removed
* Updated the FileOpener StarterPage for the DefaultUseCae, so you can only select one file
  DefaultParser.cs removed
* DefaultSolution uses the CSVParser per default
  Dont't hide Exceptions during Project Start in Debug mode
  CSVParser gives meaningful error message if a line contains the wrong number of columns
* Made the ProjectStarterPage a normal class, otherwise the Visual Studio Designer can't display the derived classes
* Moved CSVParser from Pavel to the DefaultSolution Plugin
* Added parameter-less constructor for CSV-Parser, this fixed a bug with instantiating the CSV-Parser through reflection
* Only show SpaceSelectDialog if there is more than one Space or PointSet
* Removed a tiny bug in the new CSV-Parser
* CHM-help project added
* Simplified the csv-parser to enable easier import. Added support for different splitter-symbols and decimal-Seperators.
* Corrected some descriptions of the properties of the Scatterplot (Default value for point size is 8, but was said to be 3, Default for Alpha-value is 80%, but the description said 50%).
* Opening a Scatterplot from the Scattermatrix now results in a 2D Scatterplot instead of a 3D Scatterplot.
* Removed the STLNormalSwitcher, as it is no longer part of Pavel, but has its own repository.
* RTF Versions of License files removed
* Init (from Revision 2231)
