COMPILING
=========

Pavel was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional
using C# 2.0.

In order to successfully compile Pavel you should have installed:

- .NET Framework 2.0 (later versions _might_ work)
- The TAO Framework 2.0.0 (again, later versions might work)
  http://downloads.sourceforge.net/taoframework/tao-2.0.0-setup.exe

Load the Pavel.sln into Visual Studio and compile. This compiles
the Projects "Pavel" as well as the external Plugin Projects.

TESTS
=====

In order to run the tests in the "Pavel Tests" Project, you need
the nUnit Framework (http://www.nunit.org) installed. During the
development of Pavel NUnit-Net-2.0 2.2.8 was used.

MONO
====

Pavel was not developed for or tested on Mono (http://www.mono-project.com).
It doesn't use many Win32-specific API calls though and while a port will
definetly be more complicated than just a recompilation of the sources under mono,
there shouldn't be too many adjustments necessary.
